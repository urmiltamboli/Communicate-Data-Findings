## Summary of Findings

> I found many insights from this investigation. I found out that the number of bike rides have been incresed over the months from 2017-2018. The are many frequents men riders than female but the average time span for female more than any othet gender. Also, there are more subscribers as compared to customers but regarding that, the duration of trip is more for customers is more than subscribers which suggests that subscrubers use it for school or work commute while customers use it for leisure. The age group of 30-40 is mostly using bike followed by 20-30. 

## Key Insights for Presentation

> How customer use bike on the weekends while there are less subscribers on the weekend which confirms that subscribers use it for work and school while customers use it for leisure. Most duartion of trips are less than 16 minute long. Customer (non-membership) trip duartion is higher in average compared to a subscriber.
